**Initial Setup**

1. Download the "Load Detector" from [here](https://github.com/drtchops/LiveSplit.GTAV64/releases/latest). Unzip it and put it wherever you will be able to access it easily when you need it.
2. Download the "LiveSplit Server" LiveSplit component from the [LiveSplit Components page](http://livesplit.org/components/). Extract the files into your LiveSplit's "Components" folder.
3. Download the "Alternate Timing Method" LiveSplit component from the [LiveSplit Components page](http://livesplit.org/components/). Extract the files into your LiveSplit's "Components" folder.
4. Open LiveSplit and add "LiveSplit Server" (under "Control") and "Alternate Timing Method" (under "Information") to your layout. "LiveSplit Server" will not show anything on your layout, but "Alternate Timing Method" will show your time without loads. *Make sure to save your layout and add them to any other layouts you may use for this game!*
5. Make sure your LiveSplit is set to show Real Time in the main splits; right-click > Compare Against > Real Time.

**For Every Use**

1. Open the "LiveSplit.GTAV64" EXE from wherever you put it.
2. In LiveSplit, right-click > Control > Start Server. The "GTAV Load Detector" window should now show a green tick next to "LiveSplit link".

Your splits should now display the real time and the time without loads (by default this will be called "Game Time" but you can change that through the settings of the component on the layout), all the time, as long as you do these things every time and use the same layout.

**Other Help/Information**

- If your game is open but the "GTAV Load Detector" window only shows "Loading: -", run the "LiveSplit.GTAV64" EXE as an administrator (right-click > Run as administrator).
- The "GTAV Load Detector" will show you an error if your version of the game is not supported. We currently support these versions: Steam 463.1/393.4 and RGSC ("retail") 463.1/393.4/372.2.
